# college_assignments

Some of the assignments I've done during my college years. Sadly I'm not am unfortunate combination of a perfectionist and 'not' a software hoarder, which means I had a tendency to delete my finished work, in which case I'll note that such a project is nowhere to be found.

Of course, there are some assignments that I'm neglecting such as trivial competitive programming problems and implementations of simple algorithms. Perhaps some I'm forgetting altogether. The reason why I'm grouping all of these in one repository is that I've gotten much better as a software developer since then.

The following table is in chronological order:

| Task name | Available |
| ------ | ------ |
| Telephone book | X |
| Paint | O | 
| XML Database | O |
| A Circus of Plates | O | 
| SIC Assembler | O |
| PASCAL compiler | O |
| Implementation of Red-Black Trees | X |
| Simple Shell | X |
| Multi-threaded Matrix Multiplication and Merge Sort | X |
| Client-Server with Sockets | O |
| Simple Login Page | X |
| Multiplayer Functionality in a Game | ? |
| Huffman-based Compression/Decompression | O |
| Web-based Hotel Reservation System | X |
| ? | ? |

The projects themselves will be added as soon as I have time to dig them out.
